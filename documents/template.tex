This is a brief description of our visualization of the awesome data set, including some justification for the chosen methods and design choices, pointers to the highlights we are really proud of and maybe some caveats which should be taken into consideration. 

We used the following design rules when creating our submission:
\begin{itemize}
	\item edges are curves
	\item vertices are dots
\end{itemize}

As an example of references and citations if needed: Figure~\ref{fig1} shows the Utah teapot~\cite{blinn1976texture}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{Original_Utah_Teapot.jpg}
\caption{This is how images can be included} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}


The actual contest contribution should be inserted in a PDF merge tool as the second page. (Not via the \LaTeX\ includegraphics command as that would create an ugly white margin around it.)
